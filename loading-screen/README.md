## Description

This project is a minimal and elegant loading animation built using HTML and CSS only. The design features four animated dots that scale in sequence, creating a smooth and modern loading effect. Each dot pulses with a timed delay, giving the illusion of continuous motion and keeping the user engaged while content is being loaded.

The animation is lightweight, responsive, and works across modern browsers without requiring any JavaScript. It can be easily integrated into websites and applications as a preloader, loading screen, or inline loader for async tasks.

### Features

Pure HTML & CSS (no JavaScript required)
